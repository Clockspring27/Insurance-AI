This means the payout for the damaged parts will be reduced based on their age and type (e.g., 50% for rubber/nylon/plastic parts, tyres, tubes, batteries, and airbags; 30% for fibre glass components; Nil for glass parts; and other rates for other parts).\n*   **Zero Depreciation Add-on:** If you have purchased the \"Zero Depreciation\" add-on by paying an additional premium, the company will *not* deduct any amounts for depreciation for parts replaced due to damage from any covered peril, including natural disasters. However, this benefit is typically limited to the **first two claims** during your policy period. Any claims after the first two would then be subject to the standard depreciation rates mentioned above.",

    "question": "What is comprehensive insurance?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided context, the term \"comprehensive insurance\" is not explicitly defined.\n\nHowever, the document describes several key components that are typically included in a comprehensive motor insurance policy:\n\n1.  **Loss or Damage to Your Own Vehicle (Section I - \"Loss or Damage to the Vehicles Insured\")**: This part of the policy covers damage to your own vehicle.\n    *   **Insured Declared Value (IDV)**: This is the maximum amount your insurer will pay if your vehicle is a total loss (e.g., completely destroyed or stolen). It's calculated based on the manufacturer's selling price, adjusted for depreciation according to a schedule (e.g., 5% for vehicles up to 6 months old, 15% for 6 months to 1 year, up to 50% for 4-5 years old). For vehicles older than 5 years or obsolete models, the IDV is agreed upon between you and the insurer.\n    *   **Total Loss (TL) / Constructive Total Loss (CTL)**: Your vehicle is considered a CTL if the cost to retrieve and/or repair it exceeds 75% of its IDV. In such cases, the IDV is treated as the market value for the claim.\n    *   **Compulsory Deductible**: This is an amount you must pay out of your own pocket for each and every claim you make under Section I (damage to your own vehicle), even in cases of total loss. The specific amount is determined by the class of your vehicle.\n\n2.  **Liability to Third Parties**: This section covers your legal responsibility if your vehicle causes an accident that results in injury or damage to another person or their property. The company will pay sums you are legally liable for, up to the limits specified in your policy schedule.\n\n3.  **No Claim Bonus (NCB) Benefit**: This is a discount on your premium for not making any claims during the previous policy period. The percentage of discount depends on how many consecutive claim-free years you've had and how many claims (if any) you make in the current policy period. For example, if you have 4 or more prior claim-free years and make 0 claims, you could get a 50% NCB. If you make 1 claim, your NCB might reduce to 45% (under Plan 1) or 35% (under Plan 2).\n    *   **Limitation**: You will not receive any No Claim Bonus if you lodge more than three claims during the same policy period under the \"Loss or Damage to the Vehicles Insured\" section.\n\n**In simple terms:** While the document doesn't define \"comprehensive insurance\" directly, it details the two main components: coverage for damage to *your own vehicle* (including how its value is determined and what you pay out-of-pocket for claims) and coverage for *damage or injury you cause to others*. It also explains how you can get a discount for being a safe driver (No Claim Bonus).\n\n**Important Exclusions/Limitations mentioned:**\n*   Claims for laptops/mobile phones not declared when you bought the policy.\n*   Claims reported to the company more than 30 days after the loss occurred.\n*   Any amount exceeding the market value of mobile phones or laptops declared at policy issuance, after depreciation.",

    "question": "How does the No Claim Bonus work?",
    "answer": "The No Claim Bonus (NCB) is a reward system designed to benefit policyholders who do not make any claims during their insurance period. Here's how it works based on your document:\n\n**How No Claim Bonus (NCB) Works:**\n\n1.  **Discount on Own Damage Premium:** The NCB provides a discount specifically on your **Own Damage Premium**. This is the part of your insurance premium that covers damages to your own vehicle.\n2.  **Earned for Claim-Free Years:** You earn NCB by not making any claims (or having any claims pending) during the preceding full years of your insurance policy.\n3.  **Increasing Discount:** The discount percentage increases with each consecutive claim-free year, up to a maximum of 50% for five consecutive claim-free years:\n    *   **1 claim-free year:** 20% discount\n    *   **2 consecutive claim-free years:** 25% discount\n    *   **3 consecutive claim-free years:** 35% discount\n    *   **4 consecutive claim-free years:** 45% discount\n    *   **5 consecutive claim-free years:** 50% discount\n4.  **Reset upon Claim:** If you make a claim under your policy, your accumulated NCB will revert to 'Nil' (zero) at your next renewal. This means you will lose the discount you had built up.\n\n**Important Note (Sunset Clause - Historical):**\nYour document also mentions a \"Sunset Clause\" which was applicable for renewals between July 1, 2002, and June 30, 2003. If an insured was entitled to a higher NCB (55% or 65%) under older tariff rules during that specific period, that higher percentage would have been protected for subsequent renewals. However, even in such cases, if a claim arose under the policy, the NCB would still revert to 'Nil' at the next renewal.\n\n**What the document doesn't specify:**\nThe provided context focuses on the discount structure and how it's earned/lost. It does not detail aspects like:\n*   Whether NCB is transferable if you sell your vehicle and buy a new one.\n*   Whether NCB is transferable if you switch insurance providers.\n*   The specific types of claims that might or might not affect NCB (e.g., minor repairs vs. major accidents).",
